        <h2>What is Titan: Deeper Than Dark?</h2>

        <p>This game was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2023_2.</p>
        <p>In this immersive underwater journey, you pilot your own submarine, navigating the mysterious ocean depths illuminated by bioluminescent fish. Along the way, you'll explore eerie environments, fend off hostile mechanical threats, and uncover the secrets lurking beneath the waves.</p>

        <h2>Where can I play?</h2>

        <p>A little note: This game utilizes compute shaders to simulate fish movement. Downloading the game as an app will provide much better performance and is <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong>. We don't really have time to fix this - nor do we know where to start on it - but the fish seem to act differently on WebGL (browser) builds.</p>
