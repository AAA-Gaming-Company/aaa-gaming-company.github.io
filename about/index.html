          <p>
            Welcome to AAA Gaming Company, a team of passionate developers and artists who have one
            goal: creating games that you'll love to play. Sure, we might have "Company" in the name,
            but let's be honest - it's more of a group of "talented" individuals coming together to
            craft something special.
          </p>

          <h3 class="primary-fill">How It All St<span data-tricolor-a="">AAA</span>rted</h3>
          <p>
            Back in 2018, three friends, Aidan, Arlo, and Alex, found themselves sitting around
            with nothing but ideas, passion, and absolutely no clue how to make games. You see, the
            dream was clear: to create something amazing, something people would want to play. The
            only problem? We had no idea how to actually make that happen. We didn't know how to
            code, we didn't understand game design, and we didn't have a clue about the magic that
            makes a game great. But you know what they say, you've got to start somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, after a fair bit of trial, error, and late-night Googling, we "made" our first
            game. It didn't exactly set the world on fire, but hey, it ran (kind of). That
            little game was proof that we had something, and we haven't stopped since.
          </p>

          <h3 class="primary-fill">The Te<span data-tricolor-a="">AAA</span>m Today</h3>
          <p>
            Fast forward a few years and our team has grown, adding fresh faces who bring their own
            flair to the table. We're still the same bunch of passionate developers and artists, but
            now, we've got a little more know-how under our belts. While Aidan, Arlo, and Alex
            might've been the founders, we've all chipped in to make this dream a reality - though
            some of us are a little less involved these days.
          </p>

          <h3 class="primary-fill">What M<span data-tricolor-a="">AAA</span>kes Us Different?</h3>
          <p>
            We're not a faceless corporation with a thousand employees. We're just a bunch of people
            who genuinely love games and are determined to create experiences that will bring joy to
            players. From design to development, every line of code and every pixel on screen has a
            piece of us in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our games aren't always perfect (who's are?), but they're always built with heart. We
            might still make some mistakes, but that's all part of the fun, right? And believe us,
            we're learning and growing with every project we take on.
          </p>

          <h3 class="primary-fill">Wh<span data-tricolor-a="">AAA</span>ht's Next?</h3>
          <p>
            We've probably got some exciting projects on the horizon that we're pretty sure you'll
            enjoy. If you want the inside scoop, check out our devlog for updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for being part of our journey. We're just getting started, and we're thrilled
            to have you along for the ride.
