# AAA Gaming Company Website

## How to build

Simply run `python3 build.py` to generate the website in the `dist` folder. Only the required files are rebuilt.

Some flags are available:
- `--clean` to ensure that the whole website is rebuilt without any change cache
- `--deploy <path>` to deploy the website to the given path
- `--watch` to watch for changes and rebuild the website automatically (use with caution)
