        <h2>What is Trust Me Bro?</h2>

        <p>Trust Me Bro was made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.1, this was our third entry into this wonderful competition.</p>
        <p>Are you sick of never getting a date? Play this super realistic "dating sim" where nothing can go wrong... Will Buff McManlyface find true love?</p>
        <p>Aim with mouse, shift to sprint! Use WASD (or equivalent) to move around, you can also use the arrow keys if that's your thing.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Trust Me Bro ranked 8th in enjoyment and was in the top 2% overall (51st out of 2199)! See the full breakdown <a href="https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-13/rate/3270162">here</a>.</p>
